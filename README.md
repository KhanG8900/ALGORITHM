# Report for Assignment 1

## Project chosen

Name: algorithms    

URL: (https://github.com/keon/algorithms)

Number of lines of code and the tool used to count it: 18023(18 KLOC), counted using lizard

Programming language: Python

## Coverage measurement

### Existing tool

We have used coverage.py to measure the cover of our chosen project. After installing all tools and dependencies, we have 
run the tool by typing coverage run --branch -m pytest tests. Afterwards, we use coverage report to generate the report. Later, Ayman has written a scrip to run the commands in a single script, and to also skip the test files, which don't need to be tested.

In order to not put in 8 large images, I will insert the final screenshot, with the total branch coverage:

## Coverage improvement

### Individual tests

## Ayman Errahmouni

#### <Test "test_simplify_path">

An enhanced existing test

Old coverage:<br>

![alt text](image-9.png)

New coverage:<br>
![new coverage result (100%)](image-1.png)

The coverage was improved because certain cases that could happen in file paths (e.g. the "." directory, empty path) were not tested for.
By added additional tests that use such cases, the coverage improved.

The test was also faulty on windows (i guess linux was assumed), so i added support for that in the test. (It now passes on Windows 10 too)

#### <Test "test_actual_insertion_sort">

An new test. (before, `insertion_sort` was not present in any test)

Diff (LHS: new code, RHS: old code):<br>

existing tool result before:

![alt text](stoog_sort_image1.png)

![alt text](stoog_sort_image2.png)

The coverage increased by 89%, largely attributable to the implementation of new tests.

### Test 2: word_break

[Link to the commit in the test files](https://github.com/CatalinAnt/algorithms-SEP-95/commit/157de36fd4c373b67cd03e3b3713be9ba5cf0d97)

existing tool result before:

![alt text](word_break_image1.png)

existing tool result after:

![alt text](word_break_image2.png)

The coverage improved by 86% due to the creation of new tests.

the coverage is improved by 28%, the code only hit one of the five branches and cover only one of the three cases of the pythagoras theory. I added the other two cases, i could have a fourth case where none of the cases is present.

The coverage is improved by 13%, the code only hit three out of five branches and only set up two examples. I added a case where there is no unique letter.

Due to the large size of the project, the percentage only went up by one percent.

## Statement of individual contributions

<Write what each group member did>

Abdullah -> increased the coverage for two functions.

Almuthana Almustafa -> Instrumentation was added to two functions, and test cases were created for them to improve coverage.

Cataline -> Instrumentation was added to two functions, and the tests for these functions were enhanced.
