# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By contributing to this repository, you agree to abide by the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](code_of_conduct.mvznk.sw.md).

## Get Started

*   First [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository and then clone it using:
    
    git clone [gitgithub.com](mailto:it@gio):your-username/algorithms.git
    
*   After that create a branch for your changes. For example:
    
    *   add\_XXX if you will add new algorithms or data structures.
        
    *   fix\_XXX if you will fixe a bug on a certain algorithm or data structure.
        
    *   test\_XXX if you wrote a test/s.
        
    *   doc\_XXX if you added to or edited documentation.
        

You may contribute by:

*   implementing new algorithms in the repo. Be sure to keep it under right section (e.g. array](array), [dp (dp), etc). Make a new section for it if it doesn't fall under any section. Make sure that your implementation works.
    
*   optimizing or improving the existing algorithms.
    
*   adding a different solution for the problem.
    
*   finding and fixing bugs.
    
*   adding examples to explain the algorithms better.
    
*   adding test cases.
    
*   improving documentation.
    

## Pull Requests

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/keon/algorithms/compare/).

We will review and may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives. Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

*   All algorithms should be written in **Python 3**. (There are a few algorithms still in _Python 2_ syntax. You can start by converting [those](https://github.com/keon/algorithms/issues/120) to _Python 3_.)
    
*   Write clean and understandable code.
    
*   Properly comment the code and briefly explain what the algorithm is doing in the [docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#multi-line-docstrings).
    
*   You may also explain the output using a minimal example.
    
*   Try to also include a couple of test cases for the algorithm.
    
*   Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
    

## Issues

Submit a [new issue](https://github.com/keon/algorithms/issues/new) if there is an algorithm to add, or if a bug was found in an existing algorithm. Before submitting a new issue please review the [existing issues](https://github.com/keon/algorithms/issues/) to avoid creating duplicates. Also, consider resolving current issues or contributing to the discussion on an issue.
