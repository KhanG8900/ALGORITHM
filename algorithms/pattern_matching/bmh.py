"""
The Boyerâ€“Mooreâ€“Horspool algorithm or Horspool's algorithm is an algorithm for finding substrings in strings. 

complexity: The algorithm trades space for time in order to obtain an average-case complexity of O(n) on random text, although it has O(nm) in the worst case, where the length of the pattern is m and the length of the search string is n.

* @param text: 
      - text: text where the presence of a pattern
      - pattern: pattern which will be checked
* @return:
      - occurrences: list with position of Pattern Matching

* @example: 
      - bmh("Can you can a can as a canner can can a can?", "can")
      - >>> [8, 14, 23, 30, 34, 40]
