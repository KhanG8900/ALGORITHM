The ALGORITHMS Project

--------- Algorithms that i will test---------
● Arrays: Object that holds items of same type
● Backtrack: Step by step process to find all possible solution to a problem
● Tree: Data Structure which is hierarchical in structure
● Graph: Abstract data type which implements undirected and directed graphs
● Linkedlist: Basically a list of node which point to next node
● Map: Basically a key-value pair
● Maths: Collection of math operation and algorithms involving it to solve problems
● Matrix: 2D array of items which can perform math operation on them
● Search: Ability to search using different search algorithms
● Sort: Ability to sort data using different sorting algorithms
● String: Fundamental data type in computer science
